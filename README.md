This repository contains all the files related to the MatPlotLib Assignment

For this challenge, I worked with a classmate, Sishir. He himself has a roomate who has python experience and he shared what he learned from his roomate.
He walked me through everything I had trouble with and introduced some unique functions I haven't learned in class, but were very useful

Other than that, I did not get my code from any other sources.
